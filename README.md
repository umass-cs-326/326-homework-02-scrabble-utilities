# Instructions

- To run this code in the browser you need to install the VSCode [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). This will allow you to run an HTTP server inside of VSCode and load the `index.html` file in your browser.
- After you install the extension, open up the command palette (`shift-command-p` on mac, `shift-control-p` on windows/linux) and type in `Live Preview: Start Server`. This will open a side-by-side view running a web browser. However, you should open your running application in the browser at [http://localhost:3000]. You are then free to use the devtools and console in Chrome. Any edit you make to your code will automatically reload in the browser. Um, cool.
